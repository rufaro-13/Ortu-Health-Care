            Our mission is to enrich the lives of young people in our care by helping them to overcome 
            their difficulties, fulfill their potential and achieve the very best outcomes.<br/><br/>

            To achieve these objectives we believe that young people require the following:<br/><br/>

            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li>A caring environment that is safe, stable, nurturing, and non-judgmental.</li>
                <li>Carers who are understanding and compassionate.</li>
                <li>A team that has informed approaches to the development and implementation of therapeutic care programmes to meet individual needs.</li>
            </ul>

                Ortu recognises that a sense of security and belonging lay at the foundations of building resilience.<br/><br/>
                Founded on key theories and research in child development and attachment, Ortu works with The Secure Base 
                Model alongside other life-enhancing experiences that contribute to building self-esteem.<br/><br/>
                We understand how vital interactions and relationship building are to young people and how this enables them
                 to gain and make growth socially amongst the community and peer groups.<br/><br/>
                We strongly believe that Education and Social Care are intrinsically linked and we offer bespoke educational 
                packages for our residents. Gaining recognised qualifications builds confidence and enhances our young peopleâ€™s career choices and job prospects.
