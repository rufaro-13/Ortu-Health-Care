            Our mission is to enrich the lives of young people in our care by helping them to overcome 
            their difficulties, fulfill their potential and achieve the very best outcomes.<br/><br/>

            To achieve these objectives we believe that young people require the following:<br/>

            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li>A caring environment that is safe, stable, nurturing, and non-judgmental.</li>
                <li>Carers who are understanding and compassionate.</li>
                <li>A team that has informed approaches to the development and implementation of therapeutic care programmes to meet individual needs.</li>
            </ul>
